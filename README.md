# Salesforce-subscription-form
Salesforce by default does not come with a form that you can put on your website that people can fill in to subscribe to your list. This form lets you do exactly that and lets people subscribe to multiple lists. I used https://help.marketingcloud.com/en/documentation/exacttarget/subscribers/web_collect/ for reference and made my own ajax based solution which subscribes you to multiple lists without refreshing the page.

This code can be used as reference to create your own code.

Fill in your MID, DEPARTMENT NAME before using this code.

Live example of the code can be found here:
